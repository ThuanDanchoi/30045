    <h2>Pets and the Pandemic</h2>

    <p><i>A report from Animal Medicines Australia (AMA) has found that many</i> Australians took the opportunity to introduce a pet into their household during the pandemic. 
    Their survey indicated that there was a significant increase in the percent of households taking in a new dog, fish, or bird. 
    <b>Their research also indicated that pets had a number of positive influences on their lives such as:</b></p> 

    <ul>
        <li>companionship.</li>
        <li>better mental health.</li>
        <li>joy and happiness.</li>
    </ul>

    <figure>
        <figcaption id="figCaption">Fig 3. Comparison of Pet ownership in 2019 and 2021. DataSource: Your Data Source Link for Both</figcaption>
    </figure>

     

    <script>
        // JavaScript function to change the image and caption
        function changeImage(imageSource, captionText) {
            // Update image source
            document.getElementById('OriginImage').src = imageSource;

            // Update caption
            document.getElementById('figCaption').innerText = captionText;
        } 
    </script>
  

<p>With the increase in pet ownership, the AMA is encouraging policymakers to consider the needs of companion animals and their owners when considering rental, strata, and body corporate regulations as well as accepting animals in public places and transport.</p>
